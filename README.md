The user is able to enter a book title, author, rating and summary for the books they have read.
The back end of the app searches for an ISBN13 number for the book title from an external api, from which a cover for book title is searched in another API.
The entries from the user are stored in a database and displayed in a grid on the front end.
There are options to sort the book entries according to various criteria.

Bootstrap was used to create the front end, Node.js is used in the backend, PostGreSQL is used to store the database entries.
